# PlanShare (Work In Progress)

This project is currently a work in progress. I am creating a MERN based (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) social media application that will allow users to create plans and share them with their friends. The goal is to have an itinerary that can be easily sent to people when you have an idea for a meetup, date, vacation, etc. The project uses TypeScript as the primary language.
